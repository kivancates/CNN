# ðŸ§  CNN-Based MNIST Digit Classification

This project implements and analyzes various CNN architectures on the **MNIST dataset** using **PyTorch**, addressing four structured tasks:

- Q1: Baseline CNN Training  
- Q2: Architectural Variations  
- Q3: Hyperparameter Analysis  
- Q4: Failure Case Design

All implementations, analysis, and results are presented as a **PDF file**.
